# Shell-PHP-Website
Simple empty frame of a flat PHP website.
No database required. Everything is flat file, yet still dynamic.
It's not exactly commented, but it'll let you adapt pretty much any theme without much labor. Uses GET variable of X to switch pages. However that can easily be adapted to anything else.
